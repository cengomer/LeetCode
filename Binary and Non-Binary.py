Terminology:
Root: The topmost node in a tree.
Edge: The connection between one node to another.
Leaf: A node that doesn't have any children.
Depth of a Node: The number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
Height of a Tree: The maximal depth of the tree nodes.
Subtree: Any node and its descendants form a subtree of the original tree.
Tree properties:
Path: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
Acyclic: Trees cannot have cycles, which are paths where the start and end points are the same.
Connected: All nodes in a tree are connected by paths.

1
E=V−1: For any tree, the number of edges (E)
is always one less than the number of vertices (V), 
illustrating the tree's connectivity without cycles.
